# DS511_Journal

Each entry should answer these questions:

  * What were some things you learned in the module?
  
  * What do you think were the most important concepts?
  
  * What was challenging for you? How can you learn it better?
  
  * Which parts did you enjoy?

Each entry should:
  * Use full sentences to show good writing and clear thought process
  
  * Be limited to one or two paragraphs (it should be fairly brief)
  
  * File format: Use a Word doc or similar. Recycle the same file throughout the course. Action Item: Write a journal entry for this Module. It will be submitted later.

## Module 1
The most important thing I learned is some of the command function that are important to creating and using AWS to run my ubuntu instance.

List of tools that I used or thing that is important to use: 

* ssh -i kyd3zj_DS5111.pem ubuntu@<Public_IPv4> 

* 'vim Filename.file' was used to create makefile and anyother file such as python. 

* 'rm' -> remove a file or 'rm -rf' -> for directories to recursive force 

* 'mkdir' -> was to make a directory to that I used a lot. 


The challenging part was working at the command line. I have barely used the command line for coding and dealing with project in the past but most of the course deals with the command line. I am creating directories, creating makefiles, and many more at the command line. At first, when I made the makefile using 'vim makefile', I did not know how to save it. ':w' was the way to save a file that was opened using the 'vim'. When I opened the makefile later, I was not able to write in it until I hit 'esc'. To quit of the makefile, I had to 'q' and to save and quit, I had to ':wq'. These were new and important concepts that I need to pick up, but also challenging at first. I enjoyed learning what a makefile can do and the importance of it. 

## Module 2
The things I learned this week in class and outside were some of the basics for programming, such as making sure the variables are named appropriately for easy understanding. I things that that is the purpose of the Eagleson’s Law. I found the class interesting when talking about memorization because it is important that people do not spend time repeating duplicate task. It is common in the work place to maybe work on the same thing as another person because the communication was not clear and it could be said in code as well. It is better to write in a way that someone does not need to do to extra work to understand something.

A few linux setup commands that are useful:

* “bin” for binary (executable function)
  
* “lib” for library
  
* “vendor” for external packages (mostly used for “env”)

One thing that is new to me or challenging is the decorators. I found this information new and challenging. Decorators are included on the line above the function with an “@” symbol.
