# DS511_Journal

Each entry should answer these questions:

  * What were some things you learned in the module?
  
  * What do you think were the most important concepts?
  
  * What was challenging for you? How can you learn it better?
  
  * Which parts did you enjoy?

Each entry should:
  * Use full sentences to show good writing and clear thought process
  
  * Be limited to one or two paragraphs (it should be fairly brief)
  
  * File format: Use a Word doc or similar. Recycle the same file throughout the course. Action Item: Write a journal entry for this Module. It will be submitted later.

## Module 1
The most important thing I learned is some of the command function that are important to creating and using AWS to run my ubuntu instance.

List of tools that I used or thing that is important to use: 

* ssh -i kyd3zj_DS5111.pem ubuntu@<Public_IPv4> 

* 'vim Filename.file' was used to create makefile and anyother file such as python. 

* 'rm' -> remove a file or 'rm -rf' -> for directories to recursive force 

* 'mkdir' -> was to make a directory to that I used a lot. 


The challenging part was working at the command line. I have barely used the command line for coding and dealing with project in the past but most of the course deals with the command line. I am creating directories, creating makefiles, and many more at the command line. At first, when I made the makefile using 'vim makefile', I did not know how to save it. ':w' was the way to save a file that was opened using the 'vim'. When I opened the makefile later, I was not able to write in it until I hit 'esc'. To quit of the makefile, I had to 'q' and to save and quit, I had to ':wq'. These were new and important concepts that I need to pick up, but also challenging at first. I enjoyed learning what a makefile can do and the importance of it.
