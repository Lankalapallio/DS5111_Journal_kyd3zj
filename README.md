The most important thing I learned is some of the command function that are important to creating and using AWS to run my ubuntu instance.

List of tools that I used or thing that is importnat to use: 

* ssh -i kyd3zj_DS5111.pem ubuntu@<Public_IPv4> 

* 'vim Filename.file' was used to create makefile and anyother file such as python. 

* 'rm' -> remove a file or 'rm -rf' -> for directories to recursive force 

* 'mkdir' -> was to make a directory to that I used a lot.
